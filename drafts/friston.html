      "Things" exist by persisting in time.
      
      If things persist, what must they do? (Asks Friston).
      
      It depends on the coupling of the system with its environment.
      
      A rock in space doesn't need to do much to keep existing.
      
      Something like a thermostat keeps homeostasis by a simple rule-based system, without modeling
      itself as part of the world around it, nor predicting the future.
      
      More advanced "things" contain a model of the environment, not just sensors. This allows them
      to predict the future better than just measuring the present.
      
      Complex living beings need to track some properties of their environment, include themselves
      in their model of the world, predict what values will be observed in the future, plan actions
      and act when the time comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A predictive system capable of acting (such as a brain in a body), in order to keep existing,
      seeks to minimize prediction error through a combination of improving its internal model of
      the environment through active learning, and by changing the world so that it conforms better
      with its internal model.

      This process is akin to free energy minimization because free energy is an upper bound to the
      largest prediction error, so minimizing free energy is a sure way to optimize prediction performance.

      So the idea is that free energy minimization is what systems that persist in time must do
      in order to keep existing.
