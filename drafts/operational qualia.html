      Rather than asking whether Mary obtains new knowledge upon seeing color for the
      first time, we should ask what she would be capable of doing after seeing color
      that she could not do before. This avoids the ambiguity of defining "knowledge",
      and goes straight to something measurable.

      Well, I could say that she can now recognize other instances of the same color,
      or that she can tell colors apart without instruments to measure light and report
      numbers to her. However, this is not a strong example of task because after all
      her eyes are just other instruments that report straight to her brain.
