    <h1>Quantum consciousness</h1> 
    <p>
        Oh boy this is gonna be a controversial one, but allow me to indulge.
        If we consider the whole universe as a closed system, we can imagine it being described by a wave function that evolves unitarily.
        The moment we consider an observer though, we need to partition the whole universe into two parts: the observer and the rest.
        And here's the interesting takeaway: if the observer is entangled with the rest it could be that consciousness *is* the entanglement.
    </p>

        It's a nice thought in a few regards: for one we don't need to invoke new physics,
        and secondly, thanks to the Schmidt decomposition, we don't need the brain to be entangled with the whole universe,
        in fact this poses an upper bound on the amount of "stuff" that our brain would be entangled with
        (i.e. at most as many quantum degrees of freedom as the brainâ€™s).
    </p>
    <p>
        I like this idea also from the point of view of explaining qualia as the formation of new entanglement between the brain
        and the rest of the universe thanks to EM interactions, which is a process that keeps happening naturally.
        Moreover, entanglement is a correlation between states of two systems that is not possible classically,
        so this would also prevent classical simulations of consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
        One difficulty is that it seems to imply that in order for us to have a conscious experience of anything,
        there needs to be entanglement between the brain and that thing, but what if the universe
        sends (say) a pure coherent state into our retinas? Are we not going to experience it?
