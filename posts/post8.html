      Daniel Dennett likes to imagine a theory of consciousness that solves the hard problem
      (even if he doesn't like to refer to it as the hard problem) and that never involves the subjective
      point of view. Let's imagine we had such a theory. What would it look like?

      Note that it would be possible to use this theory to say things like: "hey, you see red
      in the same way I taste liver, no wonder it's not your favourite color".
      It would also become clear how to endow a system with feelings. "I can make this brick love Mozart".
      Very powerful ðŸ˜‚.

      This theory would allow us to expose the private point of view of a mind and compare
      somebody's qualia with somebody else's. Though, if this were possible for example by examining
      the neural correlates of two brains, how would this theory manage to *explain* them?

      Ultimately, a theory as we intend it can be described in natual language. Can there be a mapping between
      qualia and natural language? If there was such a mapping, why isn't it possible for Mary to 
      know the color red without ever seeing it? --> link to quantum diagonal missing coherence
