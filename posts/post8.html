    <h1>What is consciousness without free will?</h1> 
    <p>

It seems to me that consciousness has no meaning without free will.
This is a bold statement, so let's unpack what I mean by this.
</p>
<p>
Free will is the fantasy that our thoughts 
have causal power on our actions and that 
we can change the course of events merely
by thinking.
I don't think we have free will because it
doesn't make any sense: both our actions 
*and* our thoughts are caused by processes
in the brain, and surely are correlated with
each other (after all we are convinced we
exert causal power on our future), but physically
speaking there is only "one future" that unfolds
and we are just spectators.
</p>
<p>
Biologically, it seems illogical to waste 
resources on running the mind's eye only 
to have it passively spectate an 
everchanging present. 
So why would evolution select brains with 
consciousness rather than zombie brains? 
What is the evolutionary pressure?
Why give us an illusion of control rather
than no illusion at all?

Note that answers involving the brain 
simulating its environment don't say 
anything about consciousness. They only 
speak to brain function, which arguably can 
take place without a consciousness.
