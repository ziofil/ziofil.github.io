    <h1>The entropy of consciouness</h1> 
    <p>
        Let's define a state space for consciousness where states are the collection
        of qualia experienced by a conscious being. This state space is large but
        finite. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You can always define a probability distribution over the state space of a system,
        which depends on what you know about it. To reduce the entropy of the probability
        distribution you need to act on the system and to do so you need to pay a price in
        terms of some conserved quantity like energy or angular momentum, etc. Also, entropy
        that you extract needs to end up somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maxwell's demon can lower the entropy of the probability distribution over the
        states of a system for free because it uses knowledge about the system's initial state.
        This is cheating because it cannot bring the entropy below that of the distribution
        that takes into account everything it knows.
    </p>
    <p>
        And here's the idea: by definition the being experiencing its consciousness
        has exact knowledge of its state, and so from their perspective they are like
        Maxwell's demon of their own consciousness. Can we distinguish zombies from
        conscious beings by their thermodynamic characteristics?
    </p>
    <p>
        What are tasks that can be performed better with knowledge of the qualia?
