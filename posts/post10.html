    <h1>The entropy of consciouness</h1> 
    <p>
        Let's define a state space of consciousness where states are the collection
        of qualia experienced by a conscious being. This state space is large but finite.
        Can one distinguish zombies from conscious beings by their thermodynamic characteristics?
    </p>
    <p>
        To reduce the entropy of a probability distribution over the state space of a system,
        one needs to pay a price in terms of some conserved quantity like energy, and
        the entropy extracted ends up in some other system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maxwell's demon can bring a system into a state of lower entropy without paying a high price
        because it uses knowledge about the system's state.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's consider a practical example. We need a system with two states, call them A and B,
        and let's say it is initially in the state A. This system has an entropy of log(1) = 0
        because it is in a definite state which we know. Now let the system interact with
        an random/unknown system (the physical term is 'bath') and ends up in either of
        the states A and B. Now we don't know which state it ended up in, because by definition,
        we don't have access to the second system. In doing so, its entropy is now log(2),
        because it can be in one of two possible states (let's say with equal probability).
        In order to bring it back to a known state I need to put work into the system and
        force it to be in the state A again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, if we try to play this game with consciousness something funny happens: 
        we cannot not know the state of consciousness, as it's by definition our inner
        experience. If anything, after the interaction we know something about the bath!
        So it seems that consciousness always has en entropy of log(1)=0, because we always
        know its state.
