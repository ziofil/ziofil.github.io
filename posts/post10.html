    <h1>The entropy of consciouness</h1> 
    <p>
        Let's define a state space for consciousness where the states are the collection
        of qualia experienced by a conscious being. This state space is large but finite,
        because when qualia are too similar they become indistinguishale, so there is a 
        minimum state space volume.
    </p>

        I think one of two options has to be true: either the state space of consciousness
        somehow tracks the state space of the physical constitutents of the brain (its
        molecules, cells and so on), or it adds to it. I think there is a thermodynamic
        argument for testing this second hypothesis.

        You can always assign a probability distribution over the state space of a
        system, which depends on what you know about it. The max entropy principle
        helps with this assignment. To reduce the entropy of the probability distribution
        you need to either measure something about a system or act on it and change it.
        To do the latter you need to pay a price in terms of some conserved quantity like
        energy or angular momentum, etc. Also, the entropy that you extract needs to end
        up somewhere.

        Maxwell's demon can lower the entropy of a probability distribution over the states
        of a system for "free" because it uses its knowledge about the system's initial state.
        This is cheating because it cannot bring the entropy below that of the distribution
        that takes into account everything it knows: in a sense it's just pretending not to know.
    </p>
    <p>
        And here's the idea: by definition the being experiencing its consciousness
        has exact knowledge of its state, and so from their perspective they are like
        Maxwell's demon of their own consciousness. So can we distinguish zombies from
        conscious beings by their thermodynamic signature?
