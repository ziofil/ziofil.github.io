        Rather than asking whether Mary obtains new knowledge upon seeing color for the
        first time, we could ask what she can <em>do</em> after seeing it, that she could
        not do before. This goes straight to something measurable.

        One thing that comes to mind is that a qualia gives her knowledge of the internal
        state of some part of her own brain. And this privileged access to qualia again
        brings me back to Maxwell's demon who knows the microscopic state of the gas in
        the chamber, even if this state is unknowable from the outside.

        So what does it mean for her to "know" the state? Perhaps it means that some degrees of
        freedom in the brain (the ones responsible for the self-knowledge) are tracking the
        degrees of freedom that are responsible for instantiating the qualia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this type of self-knowledge / self-reference lead to a measurable difference?
