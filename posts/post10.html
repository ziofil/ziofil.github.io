    <h1>The entropy of consciouness</h1> 
    <p>
        Sometimes I try to ground myself in the most fundamental principles in physics.
        One of them is Landauer principle which states that erasing information (i.e.
        reducing the number of possible states of a system) requires a cost in terms
        of some conserved quantity, usually energy.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I consider the inner experience that we intend as consciousness, I
        notice that it has parts with finite size (e.g. I cannot subdivide my vision
        field into parts that are smaller than a certain amount), and these parts
        have a finite amount of qualities to them (e.g. I cannot distinguish colors
        that are too similar, or sounds that are too close in frequency).
    </p>
    <p>
        So effectively, consciousness has a finite state space, and I would argue
        that processes that reset its state would be subject to Landauer's principle.
        So here's the idea: does a zombie identical to me have a different thermodynamic
        signature than me? If the only difference between us is that I have a consciouness
        and the zombie doesn't, then it could be that doing operations on the canvas of
        consciouness produces detectable amounts of heat that the zombie brain would
        not produce.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's consider a practical example. We need a system with two states, call them A and B,
        and let's say it is initially in the state A. This system has an entropy of log(1) = 0
        because it is in a definite state which we know. Now let the system interact with
        an random/unknown system (the physical term is 'bath') and ends up in either of
        the states A and B. Now we don't know which state it ended up in, because by definition,
        we don't have access to the second system. In doing so, its entropy is now log(2),
        because it can be in one of two possible states (let's say with equal probability).
        In order to bring it back to a known state I need to put work into the system and
        force it to be in the state A again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, if we try to play this game with consciousness something funny happens: 
        we cannot not know the state of consciousness, as it's by definition our inner
        experience. If anything, after the interaction we know something about the bath!
        So it seems that consciousness always has en entropy of log(1)=0, because we always
        know its state.
