      Daniel Dennett likes to imagine a theory of consciousness that never involves the subjective
      point of view. Let's imagine we had such a theory. What would it look like?

      It would empower us to say things like: "hey, you see red in the same way I taste onion,
      no wonder it's not your favourite color".
      It would also become clear how to endow a system with feelings. "I can make this brick love Mozart".
      Very powerful 😂. Jokes aside, such a theory would expose the private point of view of a mind and compare
      somebody's qualia with somebody else's.

      Ultimately, a theory as we intend it can be described in natual language. Can there be a mapping between
      qualia and natural language? If there was such a mapping, why isn't it possible for Mary to 
      know the color red without ever seeing it? --> link to quantum diagonal missing coherence
