    <h1>In favour of simulability</h1> 
  <p>
    One could say that a strongly emergent phenomenon, even though it is realized in terms of its constituents, can
    exist independently of it and potentially be realized in different ways.
    This is an argument in favour of creating consciousness by way of a simulation, if we think of consciousness
    as a strongly emergent phenomenon that is characterized by the "semantics" of the underlying processes.
    In our reality these processes happen to be taking place in squishy nerves,
    but by all means could also take place in the meandering circuits of a silicon chip.
