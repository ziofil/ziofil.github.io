    <h1>In favour of simulability</h1> 
  <p>
    A strongly emergent phenomenon, even if realized in terms of its substrate, may
    exist independently of it and potentially be realized in alternative ways.
    This is an argument in favour of creating consciousness by way of a simulation, if we think of consciousness
    as a phenomenon that is strongly emergent from the "semantics" of the underlying processes.
    In our reality these processes happen to be taking place in squishy nerves,
    but they could also take place in the meandering circuits of a silicon chip, or elsewhere.

    Additionally, our meaning of "reduction" could be a bit idiosyncratic.
    Reduction prescribes decomposing a whole into parts, but the definition of "parts" could be more general
    than the way atoms are a decomposition of matter, or the way people are a decomposition of society.
    We are very much married to spatio-temporal categories because quantum decoherence happens to choose 
    position as a pointer state (in the quantum to classical transition, out of the infinitude of bases of the quantum state space,
    the position basis is the one that is least perturbed by decoherence).
    So in our macroscopic reality where objects are identified by their position
    and not by the eignevalues of some weird observable that is a combination of position and momentum,
    we think of reduction through that lens. Letting go of this may enlarge our understanding of what a simulation is.
