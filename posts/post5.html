    <h1>In favour of simulability</h1> 
  <p>
    A strongly emergent phenomenon, even though it is realized in terms of its substrate, may
    exist independently of it and potentially be realized in different ways.
    This is an argument in favour of creating consciousness by way of a simulation, if we think of consciousness
    as a strongly emergent phenomenon that is characterized by the "semantics" of the underlying processes.
    In our reality these processes happen to be taking place in squishy nerves,
    but by all means could also take place in the meandering circuits of a silicon chip.

    Also, our meaning of reduction could be idiosyncratic and there may be a more general way of understanding it.
    Reduction prescribes decomposing a whole into parts, but the definition of "parts" may be more general
    than the way atoms are a decomposition of matter, or the way people are a decomposition of society.
    We are very much married to spatio-temporal categories because quantum decoherence happens to choose 
    position as a pointer state (in the quantum to classical transition, out of the infinitude of bases of the quantum state space,
    the position basis is the one that is least perturbed by decoherence). So in our reality where the macroscopic world
    that we experience favours objects having a defined position
    (and not being eigenstates of some weird observable that is a combination of position and momentum),
    we think of reduction in those same terms, which may enlarge our understanding of what a simulation is.
