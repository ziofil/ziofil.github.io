    <h1>In favour of simulability</h1>

    One could say that a strongly emergent phenomenon, even though it is realized in terms of its substrate, can
    exist independently of it and potentially be realized in different ways.
    This is an argument in favour of creating consciousness by way of a simulation, if we think of consciousness
    as a strongly emergent phenomenon that is characterized by the "semantics" of the underlying processes.
    In our reality these processes happen to be taking place in squishy nerves,
    but by all means could also take place in the meandering circuits of a silicon chip.

    Also, it should be pointed out that our meaning of reduction could be idiosyncratic.
    It supposes decomposing a whole into parts, but the existence of parts may be understood more generally
    than the way atoms are a decomposition of matter, or the way people are a decomposition of society.
    We are very much married to spatio-temporal categories because of the fact that quantum decoherence happens to choose 
    position as a pointer state (in the quantum to classical transition, out of the infinitude of bases of a Hilbert space,
    the position basis is the one that is less perturbed by decoherence). So in our reality where the macroscopic world
    that we experience favours objects having a defined position
    (and not some other weird observable that is a combination of position and momentum),
    we think of reduction in those same terms, which may be limiting the ways we understand what a simulation is.
