    <h1>Strong emergence</h1> 
  <p>
    From a materialistic/physicalist perspective, consciousness could be a strongly emergent phenomenon
    that arises from the underlying physical processes. Not that this perspective would solve
    the hard problem, but at least it provides a mechanism that allows for radically
    different phenomena such as consciousness to emerge.
  </p>
  <p>
    For clarity, let's distinguish weak from strong emergence.
    A weakly emergent phenomenon can in principle be predicted from the underlying systems and explained by understanding
    the behavior of their individual parts and the rules that govern their interactions
    (regardless of how difficult it may be, e.g. when simulating chaos or quantum mechanics).
    Examples are flocking behaviour, traffic patterns, collective decision-making.
    In a nutshell, weak emergence says we cannot "go up" in the sense that we cannot predict high-level
    properties of complex systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, a strongly emergent phenomenon cannot be predicted or modelled from the lower levels.
    In other words, strong emergence says we cannot "go down" in the sense that even when the phenomenon
    is known, it cannot be reduced to the behaviours and interactions of its underlying systems.
