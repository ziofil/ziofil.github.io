    <h1>Strong emergence</h1> 
  <p>
    From a materialistic perspective, consciousness could be a strongly emergent phenomenon
    that arises from the underlying physical processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    A weakly emergent phenomenon can in principle be predicted from the underlying systems
    (regardless of how difficult it may be, e.g. for chaos) and explained by understanding
    the behavior of their individual parts and the rules that govern their interactions.
    Examples are flocking behaviour, traffic patterns, collective decision-making.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, a strongly emergent phenomenon cannot be predicted or modelled from the lower levels.
    It may be possible to reduce it and justify it once it's known, but this would be a "downward" exercise,
    as opposed to emergence (in this mental picture, causation would be horizontal).
    Examples are economic markets, life, social dynamics.
    For example, monetary transactions can occur in completely unrelated ways
    (e.g. the exchange of physical pieces of paper or some computation in some server)
    and yet they both contribute in the same way to a very real inflation.
