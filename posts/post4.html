    <h1>Strong emergence</h1> 
  <p>
    From a materialistic perspective, consciousness could be a strongly emergent phenomenon
    that arises from the underlying physical processes. Not that this perspective would solve
    the hard problem, but at least there is a mechanism that allows for radically
    novel phenomena to emerge.
  </p>
  <p>
    A weakly emergent phenomenon can in principle be predicted from the underlying systems and explained by understanding
    the behavior of their individual parts and the rules that govern their interactions
    (regardless of how difficult it may be, e.g. for chaos).
    Examples are flocking behaviour, traffic patterns, collective decision-making.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, a strongly emergent phenomenon cannot be predicted or modelled from the lower levels.
    It may be possible to reduce it and justify it in those terms once it's known, but this would be a "downward" exercise,
    as opposed to emergence which is "upward" (in this mental picture, causation is horizontal).
    For example, monetary transactions can occur in completely unrelated ways
    (e.g. the exchange of physical pieces of paper or a computation in some server)
    and yet they both contribute in the same way to high-level phenomena like inflation.
