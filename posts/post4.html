    <h1>Strong emergence</h1> 
  <p>
    From a materialistic/physicalist perspective, consciousness could be a strongly emergent phenomenon
    that arises from the underlying physical processes. Not that this perspective would directly solve the hard
    problem, but at least it provides a way for radically different phenomena such as consciousness to emerge.

    For clarity, here's how I understand emergence.
    A weakly emergent phenomenon can in principle be predicted from the underlying systems and explained
    by understanding the behavior of the individual parts and the rules that govern their interactions,
    regardless of how difficult it may be (e.g. a chaotic system with large enough Lyapunov exponent).
    Examples are flocking behaviour, traffic patterns, collective decision-making, the weather.
    In contrast, a strongly emergent phenomenon cannot be modelled from the lower levels in the sense that the
    phenomenon cannot be reduced to the behaviours and interactions of its parts. The existence of strongly emergent
    phenomena is slightly controversial, especially for reductionists who maintain that at most weakly emergent phenomena exist.
