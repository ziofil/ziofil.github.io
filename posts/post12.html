    <h1>The free energy principle</h1> 
    <p>
      The free energy principle by Karl Friston is a 
      of physical systems and their dynamics.

      Free energy is an upper bound to the largest prediction error of a model.
      So minimizing free energy is a sure way to optimize prediction performance.
      
      A predictive system capable of acting (such as a brain), in order to keep existing,
      seeks minimize free energy via a combination of improving its internal model of the world
      (by learning on new data) and by changing the world so that it conforms
      better with its internal model.

      In the free energy principle, "things" exist by persisting in time and are identified by a 
      sparsity of degrees of freedom coupled with the rest of the universe.
      This can be generalized to Markov blankets (sets of random variables that are sufficient to infer
      a given random variable)

      #####
      One can now
      talk of states of the thing in their own right and the coupling manifests itself
      in some of the properties of the thing "tracking" properties of the rest (in the sense of
      being in the markov blanket).
      
      The set of states in a causal graph that are sufficient to infer a random variable
      are called Markov blankets. The comake it possible to apply the free energy principle across abstraction
      levels.
      
      This is the mathematical concept of a Markov blanket.
      One can now observe that the states of the systems on either side of the blanket
      track some of each other's properties.
      We can now partition the system into the two sides of the blanket, 

      is active, i.e. it can can 
      decide to minimize free energy
