# Defining the problem
The hard problem of consciousness consists in explaining the mechanism by which subjective experiences are instantiated.
Once understood, it could be possible to create consciousness or at least to detect consciousness.

One can consider secondary questions such as why should it be necessary for consciousness to exist
(couldn't a brain just do what it does without having a mind follow along and experience it?),
or explaining how "atomic" qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
Even if we explained these, the hard problem would not be solved.

One can justify why something is the way it is without ever knowing how it works.
But with consciousness it is not enough: we must understand what is the magic that makes us *feel*.
When and how do electrochemical processes create a mind that feels?
If this question is not giving you goosebumps, you should think about it some more.
