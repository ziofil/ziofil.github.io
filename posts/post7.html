    <h1>How would a solution look like?</h1> 
    <p>
        Daniel Dennett likes to imagine a theory of consciousness that solves the hard problem
        (even if he doesn't like to refer to it as the hard problem) and that never involves the subjective
        point of view. Let's imagine we had such a theory. What could it look like?

    <p>
        Note that it would be possible to use this theory to say things like: "hey, you see red
        in the same way I taste onion, no wonder it's not your favourite color".
        It would also become clear how to endow a system with feelings. "I can make this brick love mozart".
        Very powerful ðŸ˜‚.
