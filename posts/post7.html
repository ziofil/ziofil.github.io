    <h1>Mapping qualia to natural language</h1> 
    <p>
      Ultimately, a theory as we humans intend it can be laid out using natual language.
      So the question is whether there can be a mapping between qualia and natural language.
      If there were such a mapping, wouldn't it make it possible for
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument">Mary the scientist</a> to
      know the color red without ever seeing it?

      V. S. Ramachandran in his book <it>phantoms in the brain</it> wrote something that I often
      find myself going back to. Paraphrasing, he says the problem of qualia is a problem of language:
      if it's impossible to communicate my subjective experience through the bottleneck of natural language,
      what if we could connect our brains through some 'cable' that allows for a different kind of communication?

      Once again I have to make a reference to quantum physics, which faces an similar issue.
      Imagine a quantum circuit that is processing quantum information. While it chugs away, if we want to describe what
      is happening in a full way, there are cases where it requires an exponentially large amount of resources.
      So while the actual real system can be relatively small (e.g. 100 qubits), its classical description
      is larger than the universe (ua mindboggling fact in itself).
      In other words, if we really want to force a mapping between reality
      and its description, we must face the existence of blow-ups in complexity.
      I don't mean that the problem of describing qualia is the same, but there are systems
      whose description in terms of natural language exceeds the capacity of the universe, and so
      we should consider the possibility that there could be ways in which a theory of qualia may not "fit" into natural language.
