    <h1>Mapping qualia to natural language</h1> 
    <p>
      Ultimately, a theory as we humans intend it can be laid out using natual language.
      So the question is whether there can be a mapping between qualia and natural language.
      If there were such a mapping, wouldn't it make it possible for Mary to
      know the color red without ever seeing it?

      V. S. Ramachandran in his book <it>phantoms in the brain</it> wrote something that I often
      find myself going back to. Paraphrasing, he says the problem of qualia is a problem of language:
      if it's impossible to communicate my subjective experience through words, what if we could 
      connect our brains through some 'cable' that allows for a different kind of communication?

      Once again I have to make a reference to quantum physics, which faces a problem that shares some
      aspects, namely if want describe a quantum system (for instance using natural language) you need
      to use an exponentially large number of elements.
      So while a real process is relatively small (e.g. 100 qubits), the classical explanation
      is larger than the universe. In other words, if we really want to force a mapping between reality
      and its description, we must face a blow-up in complexity.
      I don't intend to say that the problem of describing qualia is the same, but the possibility of having a system
      whose description in terms of natural language exceeds the capacity of the universe is very real, and so
      we should consider the fact that a theory of qualia may too not "fit" into our classical reality.
