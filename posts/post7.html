      Ok, so let's consider the alternative that consciousness isn't identical to its description.
      
      In this case we would need to find a physical process that ontologically instantiates consciousness.

      Consider then this thought experiment. Imagine taking a working brain, removing the matter from it
      and keeping the fields. Would those electromagnetic fields instantiate a consciousness?
