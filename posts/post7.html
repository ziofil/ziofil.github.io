    <h1>Quantum consciousness?</h1> 
    <p>
        Oh boy this is gonna be a controversial one, but allow me to indulge.

        If we consider the whole universe as a closed system, we can imagine it has a wave function that evolves unitarily.
        
        However, the moment we consider an observer we need to partition the whole universe into the observer and the rest.
        
        And here's the hypothesis: as the observer is entangled with the rest, it could be that consciousness *is* the entanglement.
    </p>
    <p>
        This idea has some positive aspects: 1. We don't need to invoke new physics, and 2. Thanks to the Schmidt decomposition we don't
        need the brain to be entangled with the whole universe, but with at most as many quantum degrees of freedom as there are in the brain.
        3. It would make it not identical to its simulation, unless the simulation consists of the same kind of entanglement.

        On the other hand, it is an open question whether at the brains' end there exist quantum degrees of freedom that are as long-lived as 
        conscious processes (roughly O(tenth of a second)).

        But most importantly, what does exactly happen when and after light hits the retina? Which entanglement am I supposed to be 
        experiencing?
        
        What if the light isn't entangled with anything else?
        
        For example, a candle and a laser pointer emit incoherent and coherent light respectively.
        
        Incoherent light (the candle) can be granted benefit of the doubt and considered to be entangled with something else,
        but coherent light (the laser pointer) is by definition a pure state and therefore not entangled with anything else.
        
        Yet we experience both, so what gives?

        Perhaps they merely supply the energy for the formation of entanglement? And their qualities (intensity, frequency) determine
        the kind of entanglement and so the percept?
    </p>
    <p> 
        Moreover, entanglement is a correlation between states of two systems that is not possible classically, so this would also prevent classical simulations of consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
        One difficulty in this idea is that if consciousness equals entanglement with the universe, then what about experiencing a (strong enough) coherent state?
