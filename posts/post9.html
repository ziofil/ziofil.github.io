    <h1>What is consciousness without free will?</h1> 
    <p>

It seems to me that consciousness has no meaning without free will.

I have no idea how to instantiate free will just like I have no idea how to instantiate consciousness, but it seems
illogical to waste resources on running the mind's eye only to have it passively spectate an everchanging present.

What is the utility of storing memories as remnants of experiences if we have no control over what we happen to
be recalling and when? Where is a decision happening after a stimulus or a recalled memory?
</p>
<p>
I understand why it is so difficult to make space for it in our current understanding of the physical world,
but I also cannot sweep under the rug that consciousness would need to find a meaning if it can't be to guide
the emergence of actions.
