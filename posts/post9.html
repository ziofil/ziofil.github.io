    <h1>What is consciousness without free will?</h1> 
    <p>

It seems to me that consciousness has no meaning without free will.

I have no idea how to instantiate free will just like I have no idea how to instantiate consciousness, but it seems
illogical to waste resources on running the mind's eye only to have it passively spectate an everchanging present.
</p>
<p>
I understand why it is so difficult to make space for free will in our current understanding of the physical world,
but I also cannot sweep under the rug that consciousness would need to find a new meaning if it cannot be to guide
the emergence of actions.
