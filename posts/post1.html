    <h1>defining the problem</h1>
    <p>
      The hard problem of consciousness is to explain how a subjective experience can exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are secondary problems such as explaining why/if it is necessary
      (couldn't a brain just do what it does without a mind subjectively experiencing it?),
      or how multiple simple qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
      However, even if we explained these problems, the hard problem would still remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, think of a simple quale (e.g. seeing a uniform color, hearing a single tone, etc).
      we can then wonder <em>who</em> is experiencing the quale. From a physical point of view, the external 
      world interacts with the brain through electromagnetic (EM) effects (the other options being gravity and nuclear forces, 
      neither of which in principle should matter).
      Some of the effects of the interaction are permanent and result in a modification of the brain, and some are 
      transitory and their effects eventually dissipate as heat, leaving practically no trace.
      Pretty boring as an explanation, and in fairness it's not really explaining anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine the brain as a substrate and the effects of the external world as propagating througout it.
      So is the mind in the substrate? Or is the mind in the EM fields that push chemicals around?
