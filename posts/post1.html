        The hard problem of consciousness consists in explaining the mechanism by which subjective
        experiences are instantiated. Once understood, it could be possible to create consciousness
        or at least to detect consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        One can consider secondary questions such as why should it be necessary for consciousness
        to exist (couldn't a brain just do what it does without having a mind follow along and
        experience it?), or explaining how "atomic" qualia are woven together into the seamless
        reality that we experience.

        Even if we explained these, the hard problem would not be solved.

        One can justify why something is the way it is without ever knowing how it works, but with
        consciousness it is not enough: we must understand what is the magic that makes us *feel*.

      <p>
        When and how do electrochemical processes create a mind that feels? If this question is not
        giving you goosebumps, you should think about it some more.

        One possibility is that consciousness is virtual, in the sense that it is based on information
        processing. Another possibility is that consciousness is fundamental, like electromagnetism.

        Robert Kuhn has written a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610723001128">comprehensive article</a>
        summarizing these and many other camps.

        My favourite point of view at the moment is that consciousness is fundamental, which means
        conscious events can in principle occur naturally, without a body or a brain. But just like 
        elements in nature don't self-assemble into a smartphone, conscious events don't self-assemble
        into a mind. For that to happen one needs a complex system to orchestrate them, like a brain.
