      <h1>defining the problem</h1>
      <p>
        The most fundamental problem with consciousness is to explain how a subjective experience can take place.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are secondary problems such as explaining why/if it is necessary
        (couldn't a brain just do what it does without anyone subjectively experiencing it?),
        or how multiple simple qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
        However, even if we explained these problems, the hard problem would still remain.
