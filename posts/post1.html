    <h1>Defining the problem</h1>
    <p>
      The hard problem of consciousness is to explain how subjective experiences can exist
      and why they feel the way they do.
      It is a problem so radically different than any other because it can only be characterized subjectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can come up with secondary problems such as explaining if it is necessary for consciousness to exist
      (couldn't a brain just do what it does without a mind subjectively experiencing it),
      or how simple qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
      However, even if we explained these, the hard problem would still remain.
