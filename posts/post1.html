  <p>
    The main issue with consciousness is to explain how a subjective experience can take place.

    There are secondary problems such as explaining why is it necessary at all (couldn't a brain just do what it does without anyone being 'there' to subjectively witness it?),
    or how multiple simple qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
