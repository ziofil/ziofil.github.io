    <h1>Defining the problem</h1>
    <p>
      The hard problem of consciousness is to explain how subjective experiences exist
      and how it is that they feel the way they do.
      It is a problem so radically different than any other because it can only be characterized subjectively.
    </p>

      One can come up with secondary problems such as explaining why it should be necessary for consciousness to exist
      (couldn't a brain just do what it does without having a mind follow along and experience it?),
      or explaining how simple qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
      Even if we explained these, the hard problem would not go away.

      I think that the choice of "how" in the first paragraph matters. One can explain why something is the way it is without ever knowing how it works.
      But with consciousness it is not enough: we must understand what is the astonishing magic that make it possible for us to *feel*.
      If the fact that some chemical reactions are accompanied by a mind is not giving you goosebumps, you should think about it some more.
      This happens in our brain, the most remarkable lump of matter in the known Universe.
