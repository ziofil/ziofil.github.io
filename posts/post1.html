      <h1>what is the problem?</h1>
      <p>
        The main issue with consciousness is to explain how a subjective experience can take place.
    
        There are secondary problems such as explaining why is it necessary at all (couldn't a brain just do what it does without anyone being 'there' to subjectively witness it?),
        or how multiple simple qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
