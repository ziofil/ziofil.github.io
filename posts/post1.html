    <h1>defining the problem</h1>
    <p>
      The most fundamental problem with consciousness is to explain how a subjective experience can take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are secondary problems such as explaining why/if it is necessary
      (couldn't a brain just do what it does without anyone subjectively experiencing it?),
      or how multiple simple qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
      However, even if we explained these problems, the hard problem would still remain.

      So, take the simplest quale you can think of (e.g. seeing a uniform color, hearing a single tone, etc).
      We can then wonder <em>who</em> is experiencing the quale. From a physical point of view, the external 
      world interacts with the brain through electromagnetic effects (the other options being gravity and nuclear forces, 
      neither of which should matter here). Part of the interaction is permanent and results in memories, part is 
      transitory and its effects eventually dissipate as heat. Pretty boring as an explanation, and in fairness
      it doesn't really explain anything.
