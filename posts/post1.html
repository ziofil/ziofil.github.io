    <h1>Defining the problem</h1>
    <p>
      The hard problem of consciousness is to explain the mechanism by which subjective experiences are instantiated.
      It is a problem unlike any other, because as far as we know it can only be characterized subjectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can come up with secondary problems such as explaining why it should be necessary for consciousness to exist
      (couldn't a brain just do what it does without having a mind follow along and experience it all?),
      or explaining how "atomic" qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
      Even if we explained these, the hard problem would not go away.

      One can explain why something is the way it is without ever knowing how it works.
      But with consciousness it is not enough: we must understand what is the astonishing magic that makes it possible for us to *feel*.
      If the fact that some chemical reactions are accompanied by a mind is not giving you goosebumps, you should think about it some more.
      Put a hand on your head and ponder how is this happening in there, in your brain, the most remarkable lump of matter in the known Universe.
