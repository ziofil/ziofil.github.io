    <h1>Defining the problem</h1>
    <p>
      The hard problem of consciousness consists in explaining the mechanism by which subjective experiences are instantiated.
      It is a problem unlike any other, because as far as we understand, it can only be characterized subjectively.
      Once understood, it would be possible to create consciousness and to detect consciousness, as corollaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can come up with secondary questions such as why should it be necessary for consciousness to exist
      (couldn't a brain just do what it does without having a mind follow along and experience it all?),
      or explaining how "atomic" qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
      Even if we explained these, the hard problem would not quite go away.

      One can explain why something is the way it is without ever knowing how it works.
      But with consciousness it is not enough: we must understand what is the magic that makes us *feel*.
      If the fact that some chemical processes are accompanied by a mind is not giving you goosebumps, you should think about it some more.
      Put a hand on your head and ponder how this is happening in your brain, the most remarkable lump of matter in the known Universe.
