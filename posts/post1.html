    <h1>defining the problem</h1>
    <p>
      The hard problem of consciousness is to explain how subjective experiences can exist
      and why they feel like they do.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are secondary problems such as explaining if it is even necessary for consciousness to exist
      (couldn't a brain just do what it does without a mind subjectively experiencing it?),
      or how many simple qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
      However, even if we explained these, the hard problem would still remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard problem is so radically different than any other because it can only be characterized subjectively.
