    <h1>defining the problem</h1>
    <p>
      The hard problem of consciousness is to explain how a subjective experience can exist
      (and how is it that they feel like they do).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are secondary problems such as explaining why/if it is necessary
      (couldn't a brain just do what it does without a mind subjectively experiencing it?),
      or how multiple simple qualia are woven together into the seamless reality that we experience.
      However, even if we explained these problems, the hard problem would still remain.
