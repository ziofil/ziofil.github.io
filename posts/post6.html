    <h1>Against simulability</h1> 
    <p>
        A simulation is the encoding of one or more properties of a system into a different system with rules in place
        to replicate some subset of the dynamics. The most common example is a computer simulation,
        whereby the behaviour of a system is encoded in an algorithm.

    <p>
        What all encodings are missing is the same ontological causality that applies to the real systems
        that are being simulated. I believe that the absence of physical causality is what prevents
        consciousness to arise from e.g. a computer simulation of the brain. That is how you make a philosophical zombie.

        There is a thought experiement that I like: suppose you are to carry out the computations of a simulation of 
        the brain by hand. Sure, it would take an absurdly long time, but this is irrelevant: in principle,
        as a consequence of our scribbling on paper, a consciousness somehow, somewhere would *feel*.
        We could even (like in Greg Egan's Permutation City) break down the computation in space and time and scatter it
        around the universe and it still would work. This implies an explosion of consciousness everywhere,
        if any physical process can be plucked and considered part of one computation (or even multiple ones).
