      On Friston's free energy principle

      "Things" exist by persisting in time and have a boundary characterized by a 'sparse' coupling
      with the environment. If things persist, what must they do? (Asks Friston). It depends on the coupling of 
      the system with its environment. A rock in space doesn't need to do much to keep existing.
      But a living being needs to have the ability to track some properties of their environment and adapt accordingly.
      Something like a thermostat keeps homeostasis by a simple rule-based system, without modeling itself as part of the world around it. More advanced "things" contain a model
      of the environment. More advanced "things" include themselves in their internal model of the world.

      A predictive system capable of acting (such as a brain in a body), in order to keep existing,
      seeks to minimize prediction error through a combination of improving its internal model of the environment
      through learning, and by changing the world so that it conforms better with its internal model.

      This process is free energy minimization because free energy is an upper bound to the largest prediction error,
      so minimizing free energy is a sure way to optimize prediction performance.

      Though the idea is that free energy minimization is what systems that persist in time must do in order to keep existing.

      I'd like to put this in terms of 
      sparsity of degrees of freedom coupled with the rest of the universe.
      This can be generalized to Markov blankets (sets of random variables that are sufficient to infer
      a given random variable)

      #####
      One can now
      talk of states of the thing in their own right and the coupling manifests itself
      in some of the properties of the thing "tracking" properties of the rest (in the sense of
      being in the markov blanket).
      
      The set of states in a causal graph that are sufficient to infer a random variable
      are called Markov blankets. The comake it possible to apply the free energy principle across abstraction
      levels.
      
      This is the mathematical concept of a Markov blanket.
      One can now observe that the states of the systems on either side of the blanket
      track some of each other's properties.
      We can now partition the system into the two sides of the blanket, onto defining things.

      is active, i.e. it can can 
      decide to minimize free energy
