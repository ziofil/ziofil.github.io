    <h1>A story the brain tells itself</h1>
    <p>
      A possible explanation of the "soft" problem of why we have a consciousness is that the brain needs to be "used by itself"
      (as the late and great Daniel Dennett put it) and provide itself a window into reality.
      So the brain tells itself a story about the world. A story not told in English, but in the language of qualia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why would the brain need to go meta and "use itself", rather than merely "function directly"?
      A reason could be that reality is full of emergent phenomena, and there is no prior learned experience that can
      fully prepare us to handle an emergent phenomenon. The most effective solution may be to have an extremely high-level
      apparatus that can learn, abstract, and simulate the world while including itself in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason is that reality is entirely different from the one we experience, and the brain
      must help itself navigate it. Reality is a frenzy of particles and fields scattering and interacting,
      and nothing is "coloured" or "smelly" or "noisy" etc. Those attributes are part of the story
      created by the brain, in order for us to have a usable interface to reality.
