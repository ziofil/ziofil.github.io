    <h1>A story the brain tells itself</h1>
    <p>
        To me the most likely explanation of the *soft* problem of why we have a consciousness is that
        the brain needs to be "used by itself", so it tells itself a story about the world that surrounds it.
        The story is not told in English, but in the language of qualia.
