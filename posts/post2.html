    <h1>A story the brain tells itself</h1>
    <p>d
        To me the most likely explanation of the *soft* problem of why we have a consciousness is that
        the brain needs to be "used by itself", so it tells itself a story about the world that surrounds it.
        The story is not told in English, but in the language of qualia.

    <p>
      There are several reasons why the brain would like to use itself and not merely 'function' directly.
      A primary one being that reality is full of strongly emergent phenomena (we will talk about this in a future post),
      and there is no prior learned experience that can fully prepare us to handle a new strongly emergent phenomenon.
      The most effective solution is to have an extremely high level apparatus that can simulate the world
      while including itself in it.
