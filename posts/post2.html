    <h1>A story the brain tells itself</h1>
    <p>
      A possible explanation of the "soft" problem of why we have a consciousness is that the brain needs to be "used by itself"
      (like Daniel Dennett, bless his soul, said) and provide itself a window into reality.
      So it tells itself a story about the world. The story is not told in English, but in the language of qualia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why would the brain need to go meta and "use itself", rather than merely "function" directly?
      A reason could be that reality is full of emergent phenomena, and there is no prior learned experience that can
      fully prepare us to handle an emergent phenomenon. The most effective solution may be to have an extremely high-level
      apparatus that can learn, abstract, and most importantly describe and simulate the world while including itself in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason is that the actual reality is entirely different from the one we experience and the brain
      must help itself navigate it. Reality is a frenzy of particles and fields scattering and interacting,
      and nothing is "coloured" or "smelly" or "noisy" etc. Those attributes exist only in our mind and are
      created by the brain in order for us to have a usable interface to reality.
