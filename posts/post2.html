    <h1>A story the brain tells itself</h1>
    <p>
      A possible explanation of the soft problem of why we have a consciousness is that
      the brain needs to be "used by itself" and provide itself a window into reality,
      so it tells itself a story about the world that surrounds it.
      The story is not told in English, but in the language of qualia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why would the brain need to go meta and "use itself", rather than merely "function" directly?
      A reason could be that reality is full of emergent phenomena (we will talk about this in a future post),
      and there is no prior learned experience that can fully prepare us to handle an emergent phenomenon.
      The most effective solution is to have an extremely high-level apparatus that can learn, abstract,
      and most importantly describe and simulate the world while including itself in it.

      Another reason is that actual reality is far from what we experience and the brain must help itself navigate it.
      Reality (I think) is a frenzy of atoms and fields scattering and interacting at pretty much all energy scales,
      and nothing is "coloured" or "smelly" or "noisy" etc. Those attributes exist only in our mind (more on this
      in a future post) and are created by the brain in order for us to have a usable interface to reality.
