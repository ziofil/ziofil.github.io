    <h1>A story the brain tells itself</h1>
    <p>
        To me the most likely explanation of the soft problem of why do we have a consciousness
        is that the brain needs to be "used" by itself, so it tells itself a 'story' about the world that surrounds it.
        The story is not in English, but it's told in the language of qualia.
    </p>
    <p>
        From a physical point of view, the external world interacts with the brain through electromagnetic
        (EM) effects (the other options being gravity and nuclear forces, neither of which in principle should matter).
        Some of the effects of the interaction are permanent and result in a modification of the brain,
        and some are transitory and their effects eventually dissipate as heat, leaving practically no trace.
        While this happens, a mind experiences the quale. How does this happen?
