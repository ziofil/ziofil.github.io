        Why do we have a consciousness at all?

        This is a softer problem than to figure out the mechanism that instantiates
        consciousness, but by solving it we might get a better handle on the hard problem. 
        
        A possible explanation is that the brain needs to be "used by itself" (as the late
        and great Daniel Dennett put it) so it conjures up a window into the real world.
        So the brain tells itself a story about the world, told in the language of qualia.

        But why would the brain need to go meta and use itself, rather than just function
        directly without instantiating a mind?

        One could argue that reality is full of emergent phenomena, and there is no prior
        learned experience that can fully prepare us to handle an emergent phenomenon.
        
        The most effective solution may be to have an extremely high-level apparatus that
        can learn, abstract, and simulate the world while including itself in it.

        This may sound acceptable, but it still does not answer the question of why bother
        with consciousness rather than performing the same processing of external stimuli,
        except without the feeling part?

        In other words, why aren't we all zombies, if it makes no difference and arguably
        it may even spare some extra resources that would be needed to run the mind?

        When I ask myself this question I can't help but to think about evolution and why it
        might have selected for conscious beings over non-conscious ones.

        Consciousness must confer some kind of advantage, but I don't know which one because
        I can conceive a brain that works like ours but without the inner light.
