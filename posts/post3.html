    <h1>Objective and subjective realities</h1> 
  <p>
    From a physical point of view, the external world couples with the brain through electromagnetic
    (EM) effects (the other contributions are gravity and nuclear forces, neither of which should matter at this scale
    and even if they do it doesn't change the point).
    Some of the effects of the interactions are permanent and result in a modification of the brain (memory, learning, etc..).
    Others are transitory and their effects eventually dissipate as heat, leaving practically no trace.
    While this happens, a mind experiences the qualia that the brain produces as a consequence of the coupling.

    As I alluded in the first post, is important to realize that the phenomena that a mind experiences are not actually 
    out there in the real world in the same form that it's experienced subjectively.
    There are no "blue doors": there are arrangements of atoms that interact with light in certains ways,
    and electromagnetic radiation reaching us and knocking onto atoms in our retinas, but nothing
    in the real world is "blue". The experience of blueness takes place entirely in our mind.

    This suggests that at *some point* in the causal chain, qualia are instantiated. When? Where? How?
