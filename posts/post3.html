    <h1>Objective and subjective realities</h1> 
  <p>
    From a physical point of view, the 
    external (let's say objective) world 
    couples with the brain 
    through electromagnetic (EM) effects 
    (the other contributions are gravity and 
    nuclear forces, neither of which should 
    matter at this scale).
    Some of the effects of the interactions 
    are permanent and result in a 
    modification of the brain (memory, 
    learning, etc..). Others are transitory 
    and their effects eventually dissipate 
    as heat, leaving practically no trace.
    While all this happens, a mind experiences 
    the qualia that the brain produces as a 
    consequence of the EM interactions.
  </p>
  <p>
    So the phenomena that a mind experiences 
    are not actually "out there" in the real 
    world, but rather consequences that are 
    ultimately experienced subjectively.
    There are no "blue doors": there are 
    arrangements of atoms that interact with 
    light in certains ways, and 
    electromagnetic radiation reaching us 
    and knocking onto atoms in our retinas, 
    but nothing in the real world is "blue". 
    The experience of blueness takes place 
    entirely subjectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    This suggests that at *some point* in 
    the causal chain, qualia are instantiated. 
    When? Where? How?
