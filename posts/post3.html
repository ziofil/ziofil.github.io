    <h1>Objective and subjective realities</h1> 
  <p>
    This is quite an obvious point, but it is important to make it.

    From a physical point of view, the world external to the brain
    couples with the brain through electromagnetic (EM) interactions.
    
    Some of the effects of the interactions are permanent and result in a 
    modification of the brain (memory, learning, etc..).
    
    Others are transitory and their effects eventually dissipate as heat.
    
    While all this happens, a mind experiences the qualia that the brain produces
    as a consequence of the EM interactions.

    This suggests two interesting facts.
    
    The first is that the phenomena that a mind experiences are not actually out there in the real
    world, but rather consequences of what's out there that are ultimately experienced subjectively.

    For example, there are no "blue" doors per se: there are arrangements of atoms that interact
    with light in certains ways, and the electromagnetic radiation that reaches our retinas produces
    certain stimuli that reach deep inside the brain, but nothing in the real world or in our brain
    is blue. The experience of blueness happens entirely subjectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second fact is that at some point in the causal chain of events, qualia get instantiated. 
    Not before the cause reaches our sensory organs, and not after the ensuing effects have dissipated.
    Somewhere in the middle some physical process <em>was</em> our subjective feeling.
