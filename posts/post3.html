    <h1>Objective and subjective realities</h1> 
  <p>
    From a physical point of view, the external world interacts with the brain through electromagnetic
    (EM) effects (the other options are gravity and nuclear forces, neither of which in principle should matter).
    Some of the effects of the interactions are permanent and result in a modification of the brain (memories etc..).
    Some others are transitory and their effects eventually dissipate as heat, leaving practically no trace.
    While this happens, a mind experiences the qualia that the brain produces as a consequence of the EM interactions.

    It is important to realize that the phenomena that a mind experiences are not actually "out there"
    in the real world in the same form that it's experienced subjectively.
    There are no "blue" doors. There are arrangements of atoms that interact with light in certains ways,
    and electromagnetic radiation bouncing all around us and knocking onto atoms in our retinas, but nothing
    in the real world is "blue". The experience of blueness takes place entirely in our mind.
