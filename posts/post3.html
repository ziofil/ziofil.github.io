    <h1>objective and subjective realities</h1> 
  <p>
    From a physical point of view, the external world interacts with the brain through electromagnetic
    (EM) effects (the other options being gravity and nuclear forces, neither of which in principle should matter).
    Some of the effects of the interactions are permanent and result in a modification of the brain (memories and what not),
    and some are transitory and their effects eventually dissipate as heat, leaving practically no trace.
    While this happens, a mind experiences the qualia that the brain produces as a consequence of the interactions.

    At this point it's worth stressing that none of the phenomena that a mind experiences are "out there" in the real world.
    The sweetness of a cherry is not a property of the cherry. The cherry surely contains arrangements of carbon and hydrogen atoms
    that make up what we call sugars, but "sweetness" is a subjective experience, not an objective property of the cherry.
